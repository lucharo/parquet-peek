## Other icon variants (not selected)

### Variant 1: Eye peeking from behind
> Minimal flat vector app icon, 128x128 pixels: A classic database cylinder (three stacked rounded elliptical disks forming a barrel shape) in soft steel blue/gray. A friendly stylized eye peeks out from behind the right side of the cylinder, in warm amber/orange color. The eye is simple with a circular iris. Clean geometric shapes, no gradients, solid colors only. Transparent or white background. Modern app icon style, works well at small sizes.

### Variant 2: Eye on top as badge
> Minimal flat vector app icon, 128x128 pixels: A classic database cylinder icon (three stacked disks, barrel shape) in cool slate blue. A small circular eye icon sits in the top-right corner like a notification badge, in bright amber/orange. The eye has a simple pupil dot. Ultra clean design, flat colors, no shadows or gradients. Transparent background. Tech app icon aesthetic.

### Variant 4: Side view with eye window
> Minimal flat vector app icon, 128x128 pixels: A database cylinder (classic DB icon, stacked disks) in steel blue with a small circular cutout/window on the front showing an eye peeking through, in amber/orange. Like looking through a porthole. Clean vector style, flat colors, no gradients or shadows. Transparent background. Simple enough to work as a 16px favicon.
